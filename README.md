Based on the `obstacle_marker.h` interface and the provided implementation, here is a concise and enhanced Markdown documentation for the main public functions of the "obstacle_marker" module. I'll also comment on the accuracy of existing comments in the code.

## Obstacle Marker Module Documentation

### Overview
The Obstacle Marker module leverages complex analysis to calculate properties and interactions regarding obstacles in a given environment. It manages the calculation of path integrals and L-values which are essential for determining homotopy classes in path planning algorithms.

### Functions

#### `initialize_obstacle_marker_func_params`
**Prototype:**
```c
F_t * initialize_obstacle_marker_func_params(Params * params, float float_tol);
```

**Description:**
Initializes and returns a pointer to an `F_t` structure containing all necessary parameters and precomputed values for obstacle marker calculations. This function integrates several private helper functions to extract parameters, compute residues, and calculate L-values.

**Parameters:**
- `params`: Pointer to a `Params` structure containing configuration parameters extracted from a JSON file.
- `float_tol`: A floating-point tolerance used for numerical comparisons.

**Returns:**
- Pointer to the initialized `F_t` structure.

**Example Usage:**
```c
Params *params = load_json("config.json");
float tol = 0.001;
F_t *F = initialize_obstacle_marker_func_params(params, tol);
```

#### `delete_obstacle_marker_func_params`
**Prototype:**
```c
void delete_obstacle_marker_func_params(F_t * F);
```

**Description:**
Frees all memory associated with an `F_t` structure initialized by `initialize_obstacle_marker_func_params`. This includes all internal matrices and dynamic arrays.

**Parameters:**
- `F`: Pointer to an `F_t` structure to be freed.

**Returns:**
- None.

**Example Usage:**
```c
delete_obstacle_marker_func_params(F);
```

#### `get_Lval`
**Prototype:**
```c
Complex get_Lval(F_t * F, int x_c, int y_c, int x_n, int y_n);
```

**Description:**
Retrieves the complex L-value corresponding to the path integral contribution between two neighboring grid points, specified by their coordinates. This function ensures the points are accessible and within valid ranges before fetching the precomputed value.

**Parameters:**
- `F`: Pointer to an initialized `F_t` structure.
- `x_c`: X-coordinate of the current grid point.
- `y_c`: Y-coordinate of the current grid point.
- `x_n`: X-coordinate of the neighboring grid point.
- `y_n`: Y-coordinate of the neighboring grid point.

**Returns:**
- Complex L-value of the obstacle marker function between the specified points.

**Example Usage:**
```c
Complex L_value = get_Lval(F, 0, 0, 1, 1);
```

#### `calculate_path_integral`
**Prototype:**
```c
Complex calculate_path_integral(float ** test_path, int num_points, F_t * F);
```

**Description:**
Calculates the complex path integral along a specified path using the obstacle marker function parameters. This function sums up the contributions between consecutive points along the path.

**Parameters:**
- `test_path`: 2D array of float coordinates representing the path.
- `num_points`: Number of points in the path.
- `F`: Pointer to an initialized `F_t` structure.

**Returns:**
- Complex-valued result of the path integral.

**Example Usage:**
```c
float **path = {{0.0, 0.0}, {1.0, 1.0}};
int points = 2;
Complex integral = calculate_path_integral(path, points, F);
```

### Remarks
The module's implementation includes a significant amount of pre-computation during initialization, which may result in longer startup times but will optimize runtime performance during actual operation.


# Parser Module 

## Overview
The Parser module is designed to handle the reading and writing of JSON configuration files using the cJSON library. This module provides functionality to parse JSON files into a `Params` structure, write matrices to JSON, and manage memory for dynamic structures.

## Functions

### `write_json`
**Prototype:**
```c
void write_json(const char* file_path, const char * key, float ** matrix, int rows, int cols);
```

**Description:**
Writes a 2-dimensional float matrix under a specified key into a JSON file at the provided file path. The matrix dimensions are defined by the rows and columns parameters.

**Parameters:**
- `file_path`: Path to the JSON file where data will be written.
- `key`: Key under which the matrix will be stored in the JSON file.
- `matrix`: Pointer to the 2-dimensional float matrix to write.
- `rows`: Number of rows in the matrix.
- `cols`: Number of columns in the matrix.

**Returns:**
- None.

**Example Usage:**
```c
float** matrix_data = {{1.0, 2.0}, {3.0, 4.0}};
write_json("config.json", "matrix_key", matrix_data, 2, 2);
```

### `load_json`
**Prototype:**
```c
Params * load_json(const char * file_name);
```

**Description:**
Loads parameters from a JSON file into a newly allocated `Params` structure. This function parses the JSON file and fills the structure with extracted float and integer values, and matrices.

**Parameters:**
- `file_name`: Path to the JSON file to be parsed.

**Returns:**
- Pointer to a newly allocated `Params` structure filled with configuration data. Returns `NULL` on parsing failure.

**Example Usage:**
```c
Params *simulation_params = load_json("config.json");
```

---

### `free_params`
**Prototype:**
```c
void free_params(Params * params);
```

**Description:**
Frees all memory allocated for a `Params` structure, including any dynamically allocated matrices within.

**Parameters:**
- `params`: Pointer to the `Params` structure to be freed.

**Returns:**
- None.

**Example Usage:**
```c
Params *params = load_json("config.json");
// Use params for processing
free_params(params);
```
