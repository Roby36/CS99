Boundary optimization:  skipping homotopy class (70.64 + 77.16i) / index 4, setting Backtrack_Path = NULL,  at iteration 4 becuase the homotopy class was not updated by A* (likely due to exceeding maximum expandible states),  with variable configuration parameter 2621.44

Boundary optimization terminated as max_it = 4 was reached

boundary_optimization terminated with inputs:
	bound = 0.30; var_start = 0.01; var_mult = 64.00
