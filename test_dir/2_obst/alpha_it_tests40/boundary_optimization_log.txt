Boundary optimization:  skipping homotopy class (-1.79 + 2.23i) / index 0, setting Backtrack_Path = NULL,  at iteration 3 becuase the fixed path metric exceeded bounds,  with variable configuration parameter 40.96

Boundary optimization terminated as no homotopy clases have been updated at iteration 4

boundary_optimization terminated with inputs:
	bound = 0.30; var_start = 0.01; var_mult = 64.00
